# Inbox Atlas for agents (MCP + HTTP)

Agents usually burn context two ways: they paste whole documents, or they grep and open file after file.
Inbox Atlas hands them the minimal context instead: the region a question maps to, the few emails or
notes inside it, and only the sentences that matter, under a token budget. When the region is empty
it returns `answerable: false`. This means no confident match, not proof that the information
does not exist. A separate `insufficient_budget` status means matches were found but did not fit.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m atlas.ingest.load_fixture                    # or your real mail (see README)
OBSIDIAN_VAULT=~/Brain uv run python -m atlas.ingest.obsidian  # notes chunked by heading, stored locally
uv run python -m atlas.index.build --encoder base --no-grok    # local embeddings, both sources, one map
```

Vault text is embedded locally and never sent to Grok at ingest. At query time only the question goes
to Grok (for facets); the packed excerpts go wherever your agent sends its context.
`.obsidian/`, `archive/`, `backup/` and `templates/` are skipped.

## Tools

| tool | what it returns |
|---|---|
| `atlas_context(question, budget_tokens=800, sources=["gmail","obsidian"])` | `answerable`, `status`, `confidence`, `reason`, `context` with source URIs, `tokens`, `response_tokens` |
| `atlas_search(query, k=10, sources)` | ranked hits with uri, title, date, a 160 char snippet and z |
| `atlas_related(topic, sources)` | calibrated yes/no with up to 3 example uris |
| `atlas_get(uri, max_tokens=1500)` | one email (`gmail:<id>`), one note section (`path.md#anchor`) or a whole note (`path.md`), capped |
| `atlas_points_of_interest(question, k_folders=5, k_notes=3, within=None)` | which vault folders a question lives in: `related`, ranked folders (path, hit notes / notes, score, top tags, best note uris, one excerpt), a compact `context` string and its `tokens`. `within="projects/"` restricts to a subtree |
| `atlas_related_folders(path, k=5)` | folders nearest to `path` by folder vector (ancestors and descendants excluded), with the cosine and shared tags and wikilinks |

Same thing over HTTP from the main server (`uv run python server.py`):

```bash
curl -s localhost:8765/api/context -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question": "when is my flight?", "budget_tokens": 300, "compact": true}'
curl -s localhost:8765/api/context/get -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "projects/Japan trip.md"}'
curl -s localhost:8765/api/context/folders -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question": "how much grip force does the claw have?", "within": "projects/robotics"}'
curl -s 'localhost:8765/api/context/related_folders?path=kitchen&k=3'
```

`atlas_context` now returns a compact payload: each excerpt appears only in `context`, together
with its citation URI, instead of being repeated in an `items` array. Clients that need the old
structured items can use `POST /api/context` with `compact: false` (the HTTP default).

`budget_tokens` caps **only the context string**, including headers and separators. Zero returns
an empty context; negative budgets are rejected. `response_tokens` measures compact JSON before
adding the counter itself; it excludes MCP transport framing and is not total agent/API usage.
Additional query-expansion and answer-generation calls have their own token costs.

## Run the MCP server

```bash
uv run --directory /path/to/inbox-atlas python mcp/server.py                  # stdio
uv run --directory /path/to/inbox-atlas python mcp/server.py --http --port 8767  # streamable HTTP at /mcp
```

Set `ATLAS_DATA` to point at another data directory and `ATLAS_ENCODER` to pick the index (default `base`).

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add inbox-atlas -- uv run --directory /path/to/inbox-atlas python mcp/server.py
# or, with the HTTP server running:
claude mcp add --transport http inbox-atlas http://127.0.0.1:8767/mcp
```

A line for the vault's `CLAUDE.md` that makes the planning system use it:
"Before opening notes, call `atlas_context`. On insufficient_budget, increase the budget. On
no_confident_match, rephrase once or try atlas_search if the question is important; avoid blind search loops."

### Hermes Agent

`~/.hermes/config.yaml` (Hermes reads MCP servers from `mcp_servers`):

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  inbox-atlas:
    command: uv
    args: ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/inbox-atlas", "python", "mcp/server.py"]
    env:
      OBSIDIAN_VAULT: /Users/you/Brain
    timeout: 60
```

or, with the HTTP server: `inbox-atlas: {url: "http://127.0.0.1:8767/mcp"}`.

### OpenClaw

`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (servers live under `mcp.servers`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "inbox-atlas": {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/inbox-atlas", "python", "mcp/server.py"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remote form: `{"transport": "streamable-http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8767/mcp"}`. Check it with
`openclaw mcp probe inbox-atlas`.

The Hermes and OpenClaw snippets follow their published docs (Hermes `mcp_servers` in config.yaml,
OpenClaw `mcp.servers` in openclaw.json) but were not run against a live install here. Any other MCP
client works with the generic stdio command above.

## How the pack is built

1. Grok turns the question into facets (cached in `data/cache/expand.json`).
2. The facets become a region; every email and note section gets a hub-corrected z score.
3. Relevance verdict: top z >= 3.0 and raw >= floor. Otherwise return `no_confident_match`.
4. Members of the region are ranked by z. The budget is the recall knob: <= 400 tokens keeps the
   core (z >= 0.6 x best) and 2 sentences per item, <= 1000 keeps z >= 0.35 x best and 4 sentences,
   above that the whole region plus near members (z >= 2) and 6 sentences.
5. Preserve single-line wraps and adjacent event details, and retain short answers such as dates,
   prices, and codes. Score the resulting sentences with the same encoder against the region;
   keep the best sentences in reading order (`...` for gaps). Bodies under 70 tokens stay whole.
6. Greedy packing checks the actual rendered context, including headers and truncation markers.
   Repeated excerpts are skipped only when source, title, sender, and date also match. Tokens use
   tiktoken cl100k_base. Full-document savings count only represented documents, once per note.

Facet expansion's sender/date filters are applied to context retrieval. Source selection remains
controlled by the caller. The rich HTTP response retains `items` and region diagnostics.

## Navigating a nested vault by folder

Second brains and agent workspaces (Obsidian vaults, Hermes and OpenClaw memory folders) are deep trees.
`atlas_points_of_interest` lets an agent find where a question lives before it reads any note
(`atlas/context/tree.py`):

1. Every folder gets a vector: the L2-normalized mean of all section vectors under it, and a local
   version that weights the folder's own notes over its descendants (half per level down). Each folder
   also carries stats: notes, direct notes, sections, last modified, top tags.
2. The question goes through the same Grok facets and hub-corrected region as `atlas_context`. The
   related? verdict is taken over the vault only (or only the `within` subtree).
3. A note scores its best section; a note is a hit when that section is in the region. A folder scores
   `(0.6 x max z + 0.4 x mean of its top 3 notes) x sqrt(hit notes / notes)`, so a folder full of hits
   beats the parent that dilutes it. An ancestor that points at exactly the same hit notes as a folder
   already listed is dropped.
4. Each listed folder gets its best note uris and one or two sentences from its best section.

Drill down with `within`: whole vault, then `within="projects/"`, then `atlas_get` on the note.
`atlas_related_folders(path)` compares folder vectors and skips the folder's own lineage.
